# The Weather APP

- Retrieve forecast data for the given address.
- Cache the forecast details for 30 minutes for all subsequent requests by zip codes.
- Display indicator if result is pulled from cache.

## How to run?

```
docker-compose up
```

Open: http://localhost:5173/

## How to run backend tests

```
docker-compose run --rm weather_api rspec --format=documentation
```


### Output

```
LocationService::Base::Address
  .sanitize
    sanitizes the string

LocationService::Radar::Client
  when a address is available
    creates an address
  when there is not connection to the API
    raise an error

LocationService::Service
  when there is not address before
    gets an address from client
    saves the address and search
  when there is an address before
    uses the existent address and creates the search
  when there is an similar query before
    hits the cache

WeatherService::Service
  when there is a forecast
    retreives the weather info without cache
    retreives the weather info from cache

WeatherService::WeatherGov::Client
  when forecast is available
    creates an address
  when there is not connection to the API
    raise an error

# Strategy

1. Create a backend/frontend for flexibility on multiple clients, ans scalability
2. The API will be GraphQL for different clients
3. Create client wrapper or use existent gems for accesing the data
4. If time externalize the backend client wrappers to gems

# Tasks

## Research
- [x] Weather public APIs
- [x] Location public API (from address)

## Backend Setup
- [x] Dockerized Rails API
- [x] Rspec
- [x] Rubocop
- [x] FactoryBot
- [x] Annotate (Models)
- [x] CORS

## Backend
- [x] Define models for location
- [x] Migrations for location
- [x] Location client (radar API)
- [x] Location service layer
- [x] Location service cache logic
- [x] Weather client (weather.gov)
- ~~Define models for weather~~ (Not needed)
- ~~Migrations for weather~~ (Not needed)
- [x] Wheater service layer
- [x] Wheater service cache feature
- [x] GrapqhQL layer

## Frontend Setup
- [x] Dockerized frontend

## Frontend
- [x] UI
- [x] Client
- [x] Connections

## Research

### Goal
- Find APIs that allows you to retreive weather data based on an address

### Outcome
- It seems weather API needs latitude and longitude as an input
- We will need another API for translate an address to latitude and longitude

## API

- Backend Rails 7 / 3.2
- FrontEnd VueJS / TailwindCSS

### GraphQL:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/graphql
```

with payload `query=`

#### Query
```grapql
query{
    forecast(addressQuery: "One Apple Park Way, Cupertino"){
        address {
            latitude
            longitude
            formalAddress
            zipcode
            informalAddress
        }
        forecasts {
            temperature
            temperatureUnit
            startTime
            endTime
            name
            relativeHumitidy
            windSpeed
            windDirection
            iconUrl
            summary
            forecastDescription
        }
        createdAt
        fromCache
    }
}
